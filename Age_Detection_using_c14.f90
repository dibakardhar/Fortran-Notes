! Data dictionary: declare constants 
REAL,PARAMETER :: LAMDA = 0.00012097 ! The radioactive decay
 ! constant of carbon 14,
 ! in units of 1/years.
! Data dictionary: declare variable types, definitions, & units 
REAL :: age ! The age of the sample (years)
REAL :: percent ! The percentage of carbon 14 remaining at the time
 ! of the measurement (%)
REAL :: ratio ! The ratio of the carbon 14 remaining at the time
 ! of the measurement to the original amount of 
 ! carbon 14 (no units)
! Prompt the user for the percentage of C-14 remaining.
WRITE (*,*) 'Enter the percentage of carbon 14 remaining:'
READ (*,*) percent
! Echo the user's input value.
WRITE (*,*) 'The remaining carbon 14 = ', percent, ' %.'
! Perform calculations
ratio = percent / 100. ! Convert to fractional ratio
age = (-1.0 / LAMDA) * log(ratio) ! Get age in years
! Tell the user about the age of the sample.
WRITE (*,*) 'The age of the sample is ', age, ' years.'
! Finish up.
